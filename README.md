# NLP-streamlit

## This is a beginners level python programming for introduction in Spacy.
## -It includes basic functionalizes like tokenizing texts and returning their lemma.
## - Returning Named Entites
## - Sentiment Analysis : Here however much  work is needed as it doesn't analyze the texts properly and model tuning is required.
## -Text Summarization : Returning summarizes of text using sumy module

## I've also built a simple streamlit webapp for this program.

### This is a very basic program and I plan to add new functionalities and improve the existing ones as a I learn.
